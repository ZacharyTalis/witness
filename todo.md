# TODO v2.4
## Long-term projects
- [ ] Graph Editor (similar to one from artless)
- [ ] Negators
- [ ] Copiers
- [ ] Xs
- [ ] Tap Solve for mobile

## Main Project (Development)
- [ ] right click to individually place start on symmetry
- [ ] custom sound (
  background (entire way through), 
  puzzle pre-start (ambience before you start drawing), 
  puzzle start (upon drawing), 
  puzzle during (while youre drawing), 
  puzzle pre-end (when you're at the endpoint), 
  puzzle cancel, puzzle fail, puzzle pre-succeed, puzzle negate, puzzle succeed-sol (happens every solution in multi-solution/perfect mode)
  puzzle succeed, puzzle succeed B, puzzle succeed C (only once per panel, based on end point)
) with [ ] loop/once & volume option
- [ ] vanilla sound library
- [ ] sequence option (
  sequence name
  sequence music (doesn't reset per puzzle, unless "challenge mode" is on, starts upon puzzle start)
  "challenge mode" / "timer" (resets progress upon F5, after first panel is solved timer & sequence music starts, when last panel is solved shows "time")
)
- [ ] proper documentation of editor
- [ ] new "benis" symbol type (complete with suspicious start points!)
- [ ] some new symbols, maybe (minesweeper if i figure the design out, (secret), something someone posted few weeks ago i have to check again but i thought it was cool)
- - [ ] Minesweeper
- - [ ] Line Division Triangle
- - [ ] Status Coloring
- - [ ] Unique Dots
- [ ] way to turn on/off puzzle transformations in editor!
- [ ] looksy randomizer! auto-generates a few panels of your configuration that are probably better than sigma's, share a code to race with others!
